# Talk to LMStudio

The purpose of this project is to be able to talkto various models in LMStudio and have it talk
back.

I can have a directory "prompts" with text files so that i can have various prompts for various types of conversations and models

I can now chat with different models using the "say" command in macos - I think I would like a different voice but any tts i use in this project must work fully offline, so will get back to this.

## Non Comprehensive Todo

- Some kind of way to do model selection
- Some nicer styling in the terminal so i can differentiate between system messages, llm msgs andmi=y msgs
- to be able to use the voice chat over a network so other machines can use it on my network
- maybe a simple web interface?
