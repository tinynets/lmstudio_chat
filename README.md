# Talk to LMStudio

The purpose of this project is to be able to talkto various models in LMStudio and have it talk
back.

-- Where i am at now

I can get audio from user usinf read_audio
I can convert this to text by running the wav_to_text script

## Next Steps

Experiment with smaller models for faster inference, maybe real time? and then skip the step where
it needs to save to a file and directly make an http request to LMStudio
